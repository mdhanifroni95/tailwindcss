  <p>Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but
   what
   about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of
   pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you
   think
   this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a
   book
   without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and
   your
   good-time buddies.</p>
